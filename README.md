# Lattice-combination algorithm

This repository contains code for our Interspeech 2019 paper titled "[Lattice-Based Lightly-Supervised Acoustic Model Training](https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/Interspeech_2019/abstracts/2533.html)". The goal is to create improved lattice supervision, and to make the best use of poor transcripts, by combining inaccurate transcripts with hypothesis lattices generated for semi-supervised training.
